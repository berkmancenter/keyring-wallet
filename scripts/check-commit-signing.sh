# Verifies commit signing is configured before allowing a commit to be made.

# This can only check the precondition, not the resulting signature: git
# signs a commit in `commit-tree`, which runs *after* every hook here, so by
# the time any hook sees a commit it's too late to reject an unsigned one.
# Actual signature enforcement lives server-side (GitHub branch protection)
# and in CI (.github/workflows/commit-checks.yml), which check the commit
# after it exists. This hook just gives fast local feedback.
